Wunderkiste is a portable music player for young children. It's designed to be very easy to use so that even a 2 year-old child can quickly understand how it works. The whole projects is entirely open source so that YOU can build and modify it easily.

- Music is selected by placing a card / tag / figurine / cuddly toy on the top surface of Wunderkiste.
- Speakers are integreated, but headphones can be used, too.
- The integrated battery lasts multiple days of heavy use and can simply be charged with a USB phone charger.
- Music is stored as `*.mp3` files on an SD card. Wunderkiste can hold a very large library of music.
- New music can easily be added without any special tools or software.
- The build uses mostly through-hole components and should be doable by anyone with basic knowledge of soldering and a handfull of tools.
- The firmware can be updated easily.
