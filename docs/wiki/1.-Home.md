# Welcome to the Wunderkiste wiki!

Here we collect documentation, guides and other resources that will help you build, use and modify your Wunderkiste.

Just like the rest of the Wunderkiste project, this is a collaborative effort and everyone is invited to help improve this wiki. Don't be shy to suggest improvements by editing the files in the `docs/wiki` folder and make a pull request.
